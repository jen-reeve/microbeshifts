## # Microbe evolution robustness
## Are the shift results robust to topological error?
## Simulations of rate shift Mk models and reestimation, how good are we at detecting?
## Plan: Simulate Mk Models on the phylogeny, and reestimate
## Introduce likely types of error (topological), see if there is any systematic trend toward
## finding shifts in the locations we obtained them.

## Progress on phylogeny paper? 
## Possibility of RevBayes...
## Where to write it up for, authorship, division of labor
